# Causal Inference for Extreme Events

## Description

Apply causal inference methods (e.g., Causal Forests) to estimate the drivers
of extreme weather events. While traditional ML focuses on prediction, it often confuses
correlation with causation. In this challenge, participants will move beyond association to
estimate the heterogeneous causal effect of climate and environmental factors on the
severity of extremes.
